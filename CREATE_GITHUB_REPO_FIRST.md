# 🚨 URGENT: Create GitHub Repository Now

## You need to create the repository first!

### Quick Steps (2 minutes):

1. **Open this link**: https://github.com/new

2. **Fill in the form**:
   - Repository name: `fitness-game-monorepo`
   - Description: `Location-based fitness game with zone capture, ML churn prediction, and real-time updates`
   - ✅ Public (recommended) or Private
   - ❌ **DO NOT** check "Initialize this repository with a README"
   - ❌ **DO NOT** add .gitignore
   - ❌ **DO NOT** add license

3. **Click "Create repository"**

4. **Come back here and run**:
```powershell
git push -u origin main
```

## That's it! Your code will be pushed to:
**https://github.com/MANEESHREDDYD/fitness-game-monorepo**

---

## Why this step is needed:
- Your local Git repository is ready ✅
- Your commits are created ✅ (b1267a7, 7839e72)
- But the GitHub repository doesn't exist yet ❌
- GitHub won't let you push to a non-existent repo

---

## After creating the repo:

Your repository will be live at:
**https://github.com/MANEESHREDDYD/fitness-game-monorepo**

It will contain:
- ✅ 95+ files
- ✅ 26,000+ lines of code
- ✅ Full documentation
- ✅ Backend API
- ✅ Mobile app
- ✅ ML pipeline
- ✅ Azure infrastructure

---

## Alternative: Install GitHub CLI (optional)

If you prefer command-line:
```powershell
# Install GitHub CLI
winget install --id GitHub.cli

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Create repo and push in one command
gh repo create fitness-game-monorepo --public --source=. --push
```

But the web method above is faster for now!

**👉 GO TO**: https://github.com/new  
**👉 CREATE**: fitness-game-monorepo  
**👉 THEN RUN**: `git push -u origin main`
